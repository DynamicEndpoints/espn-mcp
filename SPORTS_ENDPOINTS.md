## Implementation in MCP Server

The `get_sports_news` tool in `modern-server.ts` has been updated to handle these endpoint patterns:

1. **Standard sports** use the normal pattern
2. **Soccer** aggregates news from multiple major leagues
3. **Golf** uses PGA tour endpoint
4. **Tennis** aggregates ATP and WTA news
5. **F1** uses racing/f1 endpoint
6. **NCAA sports** use college-specific endpoints

## Notes

- Some sports require league-specific endpoints rather than generic sport endpoints
- ESPN API structure is inconsistent across different sports
- NASCAR endpoints could not be found - may require different API base or structure
- All tested endpoints return proper JSON responses with news articles, teams, and player information
